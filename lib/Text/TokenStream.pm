=head1 NAME

Text::TokenStream - lexer to break text up into user-defined tokens

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $lexer = Text::TokenStream::Lexer->new(
        whitespace => [qr/\s+/],
        rules => [
            word => qr/\w+/,
            sym => qr/[^\w\s]+/,
        ],
    );

    my $stream = Text::TokenStream->new(
        lexer => $lexer,
        input => "foo *",
    );

    my $tok1 = $stream->next; # --> "word" token containing "foo"
    my $tok2 = $stream->next; # --> "sym" token containing "*"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is part of a collection of classes that act together to I<lex>
(aka I<scan>) an input text into a stream of I<tokens>.

This I<token stream> class provides the stream interface, along with a notion
of the "current position" in the input text, and position-aware error
reporting. It composes L<Text::TokenStream::Role::Stream>; that role lists
the methods this class provides (so that you can easily write a parser
class that C<< L<has|Moo/has> >> a token stream which in turn C<handles>
the tokenizer methods).

The basic lexer machinery is found in L<Text::TokenStream::Lexer>; it is
separated out from the token stream so that it can be reused across many
inputs.

Tokens are instances of a class, L<Text::TokenStream::Token> by default.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

This class uses L<Moo>, and inherits the standard C<< L<new|Moo/new> >>
constructor.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 C<lexer>

An instance of L<Text::TokenStream::Lexer>; required; read-only. Will
be used to find tokens in the input.

=head2 C<input>

C<< L<Str|Types::Standard/Moose-like> >>; required; read-only. The text
that will be lexed into a stream of tokens.

=head2 C<input_name>

A C<< L<Maybe|Types::Standard/Moose-like>[L<Path|Types::Path::Tiny/Path>] >>;
read-only. Can be coerced from a string. If a defined value is present, it
should contain the name of the file that the input was read from, and that
name will be used in any error messages.

=head2 C<token_class>

The name of a class that inherits from L<Text::TokenStream::Token>;
defaults to L<Text::TokenStream::Token> itself; read-only. Tokens found
in the input will be constructed as instances of this class.

=head1 OTHER METHODS

=head2 C<collect_all>

Takes no arguments. Returns a list of all remaining tokens found in the
input.

In the current implementation, this method is provided by
L<Text::TokenStream::Role::Stream>.

=head2 C<collect_upto>

Takes a single argument indicating a token to match, as with
C<< L<Text::TokenStream::Token#matches|Text::TokenStream::Token/matches> >>.
Scans through the input until it finds a token that matches the argument,
and returns a list of all tokens I<before> the matching one. If no remaining
token in the input matches the argument, behaves as C<< L</collect_all> >>.

In the current implementation, this method is provided by
L<Text::TokenStream::Role::Stream>.

=head2 C<create_token>

Takes a listified hash of token attributes, and creates a token instance.
The token object is created by calling:

    $self->token_class->new(%data);

If you have particularly complex needs, you may wish to override this
method in a subclass.

=head2 C<current_position>

Takes no arguments. Returns the 0-based position of the first input
character that hasn't yet been returned by C<< L</next> >>.

=head2 C<err>

Takes multiple arguments, that are concatenated into an error message.
(If no arguments are supplied, acts as if you'd supplied the string
C<"Something's wrong">.) Throws an exception, reporting the locus of
the error as the current input position (using 1-based line and column
numbers).

=head2 C<fill>

Takes a single positive-integer argument. Attempts to fill an internal
buffer of already-lexed tokens so that it contains that many tokens.
Returns a boolean that is true iff there were enough tokens to do that.

=head2 C<looking_at>

Takes zero or more arguments, each of which indicates a token to match, as with
C<< L<Text::TokenStream::Token#matches|Text::TokenStream::Token/matches> >>.
Returns a boolean that is true iff there's at least one more token in the
input, and it matches the argument.

=head2 C<next>

Takes no arguments. Returns the next token found in the input, and advances
the current position past it; if no tokens remain, returns C<undef>. The
token instance is created by C<< L</create_token> >>.

=head2 C<next_of>

Takes a single argument indicating a token to match, as with
C<< L<Text::TokenStream::Token#matches|Text::TokenStream::Token/matches> >>,
and an optional string argument describing the current position (for
example, C<"in expression">, or C<"after keyword">). If there are no more
tokens in the input, reports an error at the current position, using
C<< L</err> >>. Otherwise, if the next token doesn't match the argument,
reports an error at the position of that token, using C<< L</token_err> >>.
Otherwise, the next token matches what is being looked for, so that token
is returned.

=head2 C<peek>

Takes no arguments. Returns the next token that would be returned by
C<< L</next> >>, but doesn't advance the current input position, and
a subsequent C<< L</next> >> call will return the same token.

An internal buffer is used to ensure that every token is lexed only once.

=head2 C<skip_optional>

Takes a single argument indicating a token to match, as with
C<< L<Text::TokenStream::Token#matches|Text::TokenStream::Token/matches> >>.
If there are no more tokens in the input, or the next token doesn't match
the argument, returns false; otherwise, advances past the next token, and
returns true.

=head2 C<token_err>

Takes a token as an argument, followed by multiple arguments that are
concatenated into an error message. (If no non-token arguments are
supplied, acts as if you'd supplied the string C<"Something's wrong">.)
Throws an exception, reporting the locus of the error as the position
of the token (using 1-based line and column numbers).
